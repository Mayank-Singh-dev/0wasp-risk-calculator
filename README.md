# OWASP Risk Calculator

This project is based on the guidelines and format provided by the OWASP Risk Assessment Calculator. The calculator is designed to help assess the risk of a security incident occurring based on a set of threat agents, vulnerabilities, technical impacts, and business impacts.

## Usage

In this project, the OWASP risk calculator is implemented in a chart using the React Chart.js library. The chart is manipulated according to the calculated risk factor, which is based on the input values of the four risk factors.

To use the risk calculator chart, simply input the values for the four risk factors: threat agent, vulnerability factor, technical impact, and business impact. The chart will automatically adjust based on the calculated risk factor, providing a visual representation of the level of risk.
